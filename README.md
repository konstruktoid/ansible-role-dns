# Ansible role for configuring dnsmasq and stubby

This is a Ansible role that configures [dnsmasq](https://dnsmasq.org/) as a
caching DNS server, forwarding the traffic to [stubby](https://github.com/getdnsapi/stubby)
which is acting as a DNS Privacy stub resolver.

Primary usage is on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/), or similar,
running as a local DNS on a small network.
